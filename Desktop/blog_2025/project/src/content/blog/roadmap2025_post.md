# Roadmap 2025: Building Systems for Success
Welcome to my digital space, where I'll be sharing insights on topics I find fascinating, practices I'm actively pursuing, and challenges I'm wrestling with. Consider this first post both an introduction and a roadmap—though like any good journey, expect some unexpected valleys and mountains along the way.


## Why Start Now?

The fourth quarter of 2024 marked a pivotal moment in my career. I hesitate to label it as positive or negative because I've learned that experiences, whether seemingly good or bad at the time, often reveal their true value across the span of a lifetime.

During this period, I found myself in an interesting paradox. While achieving career highs in terms of technical output, I was simultaneously growing more pessimistic about technology. The rise of AI had me questioning the point of competing in this field—how could one compete with an entity unburdened by the human necessities of caring for pets, maintaining friendships, or nurturing family relationships? I fell into what many call a quarter-life crisis, openly expressing my technological pessimism to peers. In one memorable moment, my best friend called me a "decel"—a term I had to sit with.

I knew I had become somewhat of a technology doomer, but "decel" (someone who actively tries to slow down technological progress) didn't quite fit my self-image. Yet there I was, forcing me to confront whether this was indeed who I had become.

## Finding My Voice Through Blogging

The decision to start blogging emerged as my answer to fighting this inner "decel." Initially, it seemed counterintuitive—why contribute more content to the technological acceleration I was questioning? But I realized something crucial: the value isn't just in the content itself, but in the unique convergence point that only I can offer, standing in my specific shoes, with my particular perspective.

While my individual posts might not revolutionize the internet, they offer something unique: a real-time chronicle of grappling with modern challenges using today's tools, documenting the process of discovering whether the tools and knowledge I've acquired are still relevant or have become outdated.

## Themes for 2025

Every year, I create a mission statement built around specific themes that guide my goals. For 2025, I'm focusing on three core themes:

1. **Become the Rock**: Establishing myself as a pillar of stability in my family structure
2. **Sharpen the Vessel**: Pursuing personal growth through physical challenges
3. **Plant the Tree**: Building lasting value for the future

These themes serve as my filtration system, guiding principles, and prioritization framework for the year ahead. They'll also shape the content you'll find here, as I explore topics ranging from AWS cloud technology and data analytics to Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu and small business growth.

## What to Expect

This blog will be a living document of my journey through these themes, sharing both successes and struggles along the way. While I have a planned content roadmap, I'm keeping myself open to exploring new themes as they emerge. After all, the most interesting discoveries often happen off the beaten path.

I invite you to join me on this journey of exploration, learning, and growth. Whether you're interested in technology, personal development, or simply curious about how someone else navigates the challenges of 2025, I hope you'll find value in these posts.

Let's see where this path leads us.
